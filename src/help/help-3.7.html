    <li>
        <strong>Nodes View:</strong>
        This view includes the objects of your data collection: Facebook posts, statuses or Twitter tweets and any other objects that an API is able to return.
        Usually one object corresponds to one row. Here the terms row, object and node all refer to the same concept. We apologize for being somewhat unclear.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Objects may contain other objects (they may be nested). For example, a Facebook post may have comments related to that post. When you request the
        comments for a post and a result is returned, these comments are automatically inserted under the post as single rows. You'll notice - depending on
        your operating system - an arrow or plus sign besides the objects. Clicking it, will unfold the object showing related "child"-objects. Of course,
        objects may have multiple levels or relationships.
        <br/>
        These objects have different attributes, which are displayed in the columns of the nodes view and may differ between different types or classes of
        objects. The first five columns do not change, because they are crucial throughout the whole data collection process. Other columns are shown as
        defined in the Column Setup. Multiple objects in the view can be selected at once by pressing down SHIFT or CONTROL while selecting the objects with
        the mouse. This makes bulk deletions easier and also enables a request against the API for multiple objects at once.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Nodes and their Object IDs are central concepts for the Facepager: Every request is issued against a specific node. If multiple nodes are selected (via
        SHIFT), one request for each node is issued. Usually every single of these requests depends on the Object ID of the specific node.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data View:</strong>
        This view shows all data of the selected object or row in the Nodes View. You can unfold nested data. Internally this view parses raw JSON-data as
        returned by API requests and displays the result in a tree.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Column Setup:</strong>
        One can control which data is shown in the Nodes View with the column setup. Furthermore, only these columns will be exported. Each line in this field
        defines one column. The lines correspond to a key in the Data View. For example, if you do not want to display the message of a Facebook post, simply
        delete "message" from the setup and click "Apply". Vice versa, add a key in the raw data to add a column. Instead of manually writing down keys, you
        may select a row in the Data View and click “Add Column”. Clicking “Add All Columns” will analyze all data of the selected nodes and add as many
        columns as possible. See below for more information about formulating keys.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Query Setup:</strong>
        The starting point for fetching data from an API. To the left side you find modules for different APIs. The settings to the right side give you control
        about which nodes in the Nodes View are considered and how fast or slow fetching data will proceed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Status View:</strong>
        This window is for logging and debugging purposes. Messages issued here may inform you about the details of the data collection process or any errors
        while fetching data. Inspect these messages to get a deeper understanding of how URLs are assembled based on the Query Setup.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The main work Facepager is doing for you consists of three steps for every node (see the process model below). Firstly it assembles URLs from node data and
    the query setup. Read the help section about placeholders and keys to get an understanding of the mechanism. Secondly data is requested from the web by
    using these URLs. You can see the URLs in the status log. In the third step the downloaded data is sliced up and put into the database as new nodes – ready
    for export or as new starting points for fetching data.

                    This setting works like a filter. If you select a parent node and increase node level by one, data is fetched for all child nodes. When
                    selecting multiple nodes, always check the level.

                    the types of nodes considered when fetching data. Node types are separated by comma.

                    If you increase the thread count, data is fetched in parallel. This results in faster speed when dealing with thousands of nodes. Be aware
                    that API providers may ban you if you are going too fast. You should use this option very carefully.

<p>
    With the Facebook module you can get data via the so called <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Graph API</a>. You can access public
    available data or any data you are allowed to see with your account – that is at least data about you and your friends. See the documentation provided by
    Facebook for further details. Some basic options are explained below. Look out for tooltips in the user interface, they sometimes provide some details
    about selected options.
</p>
<p>
    On Facebook every object has at least one ID. This identifier is shown in the column "Object ID" in the main window and is the starting point for all
    queries to the Facebook-API. You need to add some IDs as top nodes to get any data. Some examples for Object IDs are:

                    find this numerical id in the detail data.

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    With the Facebook Graph API you can get data about the referred objects themselves, as well as data about related objects. The relations between different
    objects are called edges. Different types of objects have different edges. For example, a page has posts, albums, likes, events and some other edges.
    Whether you fetch data about the object or about related objects depends on the resource setting explained below.

                    possible. For example, if you are interested in the feed of a page, choose “&lt;page&gt;/feed”. You then have to define the
                    &lt;page&gt;-parameter, because text in angle brackets is considered as a placeholder. Usually the &lt;page&gt;-parameter will be set to
                    &lt;Object ID&gt;, referring to the Object ID of the currently selected node.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Choose “search” as resource to search for objects by a certain search term.

                    for a Facebook post. Facebook won’t let you get all these comments at once. While the limit of the Facebook API lies at about 500,
                    Facepager automatically sets the limit to 100 if not specified otherwise in the parameters (see below). Thus, for 900 comments there are 9
"pages" of information available, each containing 100 comments. See the                    <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/v2.2?locale=de_DE#paging">documentation</a> of the Facebook Graph

                    an access token. With this access token Facepager acts on behalf of the logged in user.

    <a name="_Toc405676331">Twitter</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The concepts of fetching data from Twitter are very similar to the Facebook module described above, especially regarding pagination and login. For detailed
    information on specific options have a look at the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">documentation</a> of the REST API provided by Twitter. A
    lot of information from the documentation also shows up in tooltips when hovering with the mouse cursor over options in the query settings or even over
    keys in the data view.
</p>
<p>
In addition there is a “Twitter Streaming” tab, which allows you to fetch data from Twitter in real-time. See the    <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">documentation</a> provided by Twitter for further information.
</p>
<p>
    Starting nodes for fetching data from Twitter usually are search terms, user ids or user names. For example, if you want to get the most recent tweets of
    someone, you would add his or her username as a node. Once you fetched some tweets, take a look at the detail data. Every tweet has a unique numerical id,
    which subsequently may serve as starting point or otherwise be used in the parameters.

                <p>
                    The most basic resources are “statuses/user_timeline” to get the tweets of a specific user and “search/tweets” for searching tweets by
                    terms, hashtags or mentioned users. Tooltips with detailed explanations are showing up when you hover an item in the drop down list.

                    When selecting a resource, the drop down lists are filled automatically with possible parameters. Look out for tooltips. Some parameters
                    are mandatory, depending on the selected resource. For example, you have to provide the parameter “q” when searching tweets. Simply add
                    search terms or hashtags as nodes and set the parameter to &lt;Object ID&gt;. For getting tweets from a specific user, you either have to
                    specify the user_id or the screen_name.

                    You can’t get all tweets of all times in a single request. But you may get bunches of tweets one after another, which is called pagination.
                    Increase the maximum pages to get more results. Twitter provides different kinds of pagination and Facepager tries to automatically detect
                    the best way. See the documentation of Twitter for <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/timelines">further information</a>.

<h2>

<p>
    With the Generic module you can fetch data from a lot of different APIs. For this an API needs to fulfill two preconditions: it has to deliver JSON encoded
    data and access should be possible without sophisticated authorization procedures. Examples for APIs meeting these criteria include Youtube and Google+,
    see the presets coming with Facepager and the providers documentation. Authorization is sometimes done by access tokens, which you get from the provider
    and set as parameters in the Query Setup.

                    Every URL consists of different parts. One of these parts is called the query string, which consists of name-value pairs concatenated with
                    ampersands. The query string starts with a question mark. For example, the query string of the URL “https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/
                    api/videos?q=Facepager&amp;alt=json&amp;v=2” is “?q=Facepager&amp;alt=json&amp; v=2”. By using parameters you define the name-value pairs

                    You don’t need to use the parameter fields, the full URL may be entered into the URL path field as well. The parameter field is just a
                    convenient way to assemble query strings and to define placeholders.

<p>
    With the Files module you can download files and store them on your hard drive. This could be webpages, pictures from Facebook or any other web resource.
    For example, look at the data fetched for the Facebook page of Bob Marley. The data was fetched with the Facebook-module:
</p>
<img src="facepager_coversource.png" alt="facepager_coversource.png, 9,9kB" title="facepager_coversource" height="172" width="469" />

<p>
    You will find the URL to the cover photo in the key “cover.source”. One option would be to copy the URL and paste it into the URL path-field of the Files
    module. After specifying a folder and clicking Fetch Data you will find the picture on your hard drive in the selected folder. Additionally a child node is
    created containing information about the file location.
</p>
<p>
    Another option would be to use a placeholder in the URL path. In this example the placeholder would be “&lt;cover.source&gt;”. Please read the section
    about placeholders and keys for more information.

    <h1>
        <a name="_Toc405676334">4. About Placeholders and Keys</a>
    </h1>
</div>
<p>
    One of the main features of Facepager is, that it helps you with assembling URLs for an API. Placeholders are very useful for this, because they allow you
    to use data of your nodes. Thus, you don’t need to manually formulate URLs for every single node. In the query setup, every text in angle brackets (like
    “&lt;Object ID&gt;”) is handled as a placeholder.
</p>
<p>
    You may use these placeholders in the URL path field (or the resource field respectively) as well as in the parameter values. There are three types of
    placeholders:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    The placeholder “&lt;Object ID&gt;” is always replaced by the Object ID of the node Facepager is currently fetching data for.
</li>
<li>
    Placeholders may contain keys addressing specific values in the data of a node. For example, the placeholder “&lt;cover.source&gt;” is replaced by the
    corresponding value. You can look up the value in the Data View.
</li>
<li>
    Furthermore, placeholders used in the URL path may be defined in the parameters. The name of the placeholder is given on the left side, the value it
    should be replaced with on the right side. For example, if the URL path is set to “&lt;page&gt;/feed” you should define the placeholder “&lt;page&gt;”, so
    that it is replaced with the Object ID. See the example below.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Imagine you just added a new node "BobMarley" and you want to fetch the last 10 posts before the 1st of July in 2014 from the corresponding Facebook page.
    There are different equivalent ways to achieve this. One option would be to just type the URL with all needed parameters into the Resource field:
</p>
<img src="facepager_placeholders1.png" alt="facepager_placeholders1.png, 5,5kB" title="facepager_placeholders1" height="118" width="417" />

<p>
    While this works, it will always give you posts from the BobMarley page, even if you add other nodes to the Nodes View. The very same URL would be
    assembled with the following options, because the placeholder “&lt;Object ID&gt;” is replaced with the Object ID of the node under consideration:
</p>

<img src="facepager_placeholders2.png" alt="facepager_placeholders2.png, 3,5kB" title="facepager_placeholders2" height="108" width="403" />

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        
            <td>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        &lt;Object ID&gt; is replaced by BobMarley
                    </p>
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    In contrast to this way, the suggestions in the dropdown list of the resource field do contain completely different placeholders like “&lt;page&gt;” or
    “&lt;user&gt;”. So if you select “&lt;page&gt;/feed” as resource, you have to choose a value, which replaces the placeholder “&lt;page&gt;”. Usually this
    will be “&lt;Object ID&gt;”:
</p>
<img src="facepager_placeholders3.png" alt="facepager_placeholders3.png, 4,2kB" title="facepager_placeholders3" height="126" width="402" />

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        &lt;Object ID&gt;  is replaced by BobMarley.<br />
                        &lt;page&gt; is replaced by &lt;Object ID&gt;.<br />
                        So &lt;page&gt; is replaced by BobMarley.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    The URL path generated to fetch the data for the three example settings is always "BobMarley/feed?until=2014-07-01&amp;limit=10".
</p>
<p>
    Another useful concept of Facepager is addressing node data by keys. You can use this concept in placeholders or to define the columns of the Nodes View.
    The data underlying the Data View is formatted as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, which follows a quite simple logic of key-value
    pairs. Furthermore, data may be arranged as a nested hierarchy. Nested key-value pairs are addressed by chaining the keys separated by a dot, e.g.
    “user.name”. To quickly get a specific key you can select it in the Data View and click “Add Column”. This will add the corresponding key to the Custom
    Table Columns field right below the Data View.
</p>
<p>
    For addressing multiple values, you may use the asterisk*-Operator. Replace a key with the asterisk to address all keys on the same level. All values will
    be concatenated by semicolons. For example “comments.data.0.message” will only address the first comment, while “comments.data.*.message” will give you the
    messages of all comments, separated by semicolons:
</p>
<img src="facepager_keys1.png" alt="facepager_keys1.png, 52kB" title="facepager_keys1" />

<p>
    Remember, that only columns defined in the Column Setup are exported by Facepager. So keys relate to columns in the resulting Excel sheet, while values are
    the row-values in a single column.

        <a name="_Toc405676335">5. Using Presets</a>
    </h1>
</div>
<p>
    Use presets to store and load your settings for certain API calls. These presets store your custom table column setup, the selected query module and its
    settings. No data or private access tokens are stored! To edit presets, either load an existing one, make changes and store them as a new preset, or go to
    the presets folder and edit the preset with a text-editor.
</p>
<p>
    Presets marked with an asterisk are stored inside the application directory and are included by default. Your own presets are automatically stored in your
    user directory (e.g. C:\Users\username\Facepager\Presets) and may be copied, distributed and shared with other users.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We encourage you to share your presets with us - do so by mailing the .json-file to the authors of the Facepager and provide a short description of
        your preset!
